# Linux Validation Suite Roadmap

This roadmap is the project-status source for completed, deferred, and
undecided work. Deferred or possible work is not committed release scope.

## Completed Through v0.2.0-alpha

- Established output-contract classification and the forward-only casing and
  unit policy for new LVS-owned fields.
- Preserved compatibility aliases, raw/vendor boundaries, and the intentionally
  legacy `parsed_results_custom.json` contract.
- Completed the Storage Health baseline with normalized SMART/NVMe evidence and
  explicit raw-provider boundaries.
- Completed the Storage Benchmark baseline with standalone and profile-stage
  workflows, sequential all-internal mode, system-drive safeguards, CoW/Btrfs
  warnings, and normalized/raw artifact separation.

## Completed After v0.2.0-alpha On Main

- Completed Phase 1 contract clarifications covering legacy unit meanings,
  compatibility aliases, enum domains, storage-provider semantics, and
  deprecation tracking without changing payloads.
- Completed Phase 2A contract identities for `run_manifest.json`,
  `dependency_check.json`, and `telemetry_source_map.json`.
- Completed Phase 2B additive telemetry unit aliases. Existing binary-GiB
  `_gb` telemetry fields remain unchanged, while unit-correct `_gib` aliases
  are available to new consumers.
- Completed post-release operator and documentation cleanup for storage
  dependencies and safeguards, GUI status, CPU cooler/PPT/TDP metadata, and
  Phase 1 historical status.

## Deferred Compatibility And Output Work

- The coordinated canonical parsed-result migration to `parsed_results.json`
  is deferred.
- Compatibility-alias removal and fixed-key or unit migration are deferred to
  that coordinated breaking milestone.

## Deferred Hardware Modules

- Additional storage testing beyond the current Storage Health and Storage
  Benchmark baseline is deferred pending actual planning.
- ARM64/Linux support is a long-term goal after the core project is more
  complete and mature. It is not fully validated now and is not promised for a
  specific release.
- NIC/network testing remains deferred candidate scope, not an adopted
  roadmap. Reconsidering it requires deliberate planning for loopback
  connectors, an operator-provided `iperf3` server or external peer, a
  known-good network path, and the time to validate execution and safety
  boundaries.
- `Files/nvidia_persistence.md` is retained operator/lab guidance for current
  NVIDIA persistence and power-limit procedures. A future CLI or GUI control
  surface may be considered, but none is implemented or committed to a
  release. If pursued, it should consider AMD and Intel GPU power/control
  options rather than being NVIDIA-only.
- Other hardware-specific validation modules are TBD and are not committed
  release scope.

## Needs User Or Product Decision

- Whether GUI work should progress beyond its current TBD status.

## Do Not Touch / Intentionally Legacy

- `parsed_results_custom.json` behavior and its compatibility aliases.
- Existing compatibility-sensitive field names and established contract IDs.
- Dynamic profile sidecar stage labels.
- Raw vendor/backend property spelling inside documented raw boundaries.
- Retain `Files/nvidia_persistence.md` as operator/lab guidance; it is not a
  committed CLI or GUI feature design.
